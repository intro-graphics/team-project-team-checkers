Project proposal: English Draughts (American checkers)



Description:
We will build an interactive board for checkers. A human-player will be able to mouse-pick the pieces to move them around, and the rules of checkers will keep the player from making illegal moves. There will be a simple AI opponent for the human-player to play against.

Advanced Graphic Feature: Mouse Picking
