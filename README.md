# Project proposal: English Draughts (American checkers)

![alt text](https://github.com/intro-graphics/team-project-team-checkers/blob/master/screenshots/board.png)

## Setup:
<code>git clone</code> the github repository and run it as you would for any CS174-A assignment. Double click the **host.bat** file to start the local host. Open a chrome tab and navigate to *localhost:8000* to play.

## Playing:
He have built an interactive board for checkers. Your team is White. To make a move, click on a peice (it will light up) and click on a destination tile. The game will prevent you from making an illegal move. (Remember: if you can take an opponent's peice, you must, by the rules of Checkers). After you make your legal move, an AI opponent (Black team) will immediately play next, and it will once again be your move. The game will end once you or the AI is out of moves, and will display "Victory" or "Defeat". To restart the game at any point, press **F5** (refreshing the page).

## Additional Features:
Your camera angle can be changed under the bottom left "Checkers_Scene."

## Sources:
*Tiny Graphics* and other code-segments included from the various assigments of CS174-A are utilized in our project.
We did not use code from any other site. However, some ideas and implementations were inspired from CS174-A and CS161 course material.
